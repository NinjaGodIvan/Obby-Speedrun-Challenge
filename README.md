## **Description**

Are you a hardcore player who cares about the time and speed 
of completing the obby? If so, then come down and practice 
completing similar stages. There are only a total of 10 stages in
this game, but you can get at least the practice you need to 
complete obbies from other obby games.

## **Tools**
Lua, Roblox Studios

- Designed a Timer UI to increase elapse time, resets it, and converts
the timer (in seconds) format to **0:00**.

respawn them to their selected stages to do after they died.
- Designed a playlist that loops itself forever with selected songs using
Roblox SoundId assets.
